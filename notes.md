Put any notes for us here:
Getting the barebones of parts 1-4 took a little over 4 hours, including dinner and other small breaks.
I wasn't happy with what is was looking like, so I spent another couple hours the next day improving functionality and looks.
I then spent a few hours the next morning (24th) doing the favorites stuff. I wasn't happy with the api options I had, and it's going to lag if the list gets too long. I was also using a drag and drop library that I hadn't used before (react-beautiful-dnd), because I had no desire to work with the browser api, so I had to learn how to do that.
So total hours would probably clock in at about 8.
I'm pretty happy with what I've done though. If I were to continue working on it, I would probably add a CSS file (or preprocessor) so I didn't have to have all my styles inline, as well as some refactoring for performance and readability.
